# Monitor Stand
















The Monitor Stand is a single-material, postable, flat-pack speaker stand. Assembled using non-permanent laser-cut push locks and cut from 9mm plywood.
















## Research Page #1
















I began with research into products of this nature, looked at similar products both in terms of speaker stands and flat pack plywood products.

​

​

I realised that there isn't a popular low-cost speaker stand on the market and they are all sold as individual add-on products rather than included with the product. This and the nature of the brief lead me to design a low-cost solution.
















## Supply Chain - Plywood

​

When researching this supply chain I discovered that it uses virgin wood and gas produced glue as its components - although wood can be sustainably sourced and is recyclable in its pure form, plywood is very difficult to recycle and it is not common practice, usually ending up in an incinerator or engergy recovery plant.

​

**Acoustic Testing**

I also completed frequency sweeps & a series of musical tests using speakers at a high monitoring volume to see if the speakers began to resonate and cause unwanted vibration.

​

**Tesselation**

Twenty five monitor stands can be cut from a full size 8x4ft sheet of plywood with very little waste within the perimeter of each product aswell as the full sheet.

## Instructions
















The instructions are laser-etched onto the central piece of the product and provide a simple explaination of how to assemble using non-permanent laser-cut push locks.

## Limitations & Moving Forward
















After our initial/practical formative assessment I decided on a few points to improve:

* use a waste material that is commonly waste from speaker manufacture
* use of recyclable/recycled material
* development to packaging becomes product

​

This lead me to using the internal protecive packaging which is currently polystyrene, using Yamaha HS7's as a case study, as the packaging to itself become the stand. I knew other products used moulded pulp packaging \(eggbox material\) and began to research this.
















## Research Page #2

​

I looked into a few different products made from moulded paper pulp, aswell as this ‘hemp chair’ by werner aisslinger, made of moulded hemp fibre pulp. I also discovered these "Tube Toys" which use the packaging of the toy itself as the product.
















## Supply Chain - Moulded Paper Pulp

​

When researching this supply chain for Moulded Paper Pulp I realised how rather than just being a linear supply chain this supply chain heavily relies on recycling and allows for the product itself to be recycled itself.
















## Moulded Paper Pulp Experiments



Even though it is an industrial process, I wanted to try to make moulded pulp in the workshop.

​

**Workshop Process**

1. Laser cut basic moulds.
2. Vaccum form over each the top & bottom mould.
3. Rip newspaper into shreds & blend this with water until it has a smoothie consistency.
4. Mix 5 parts pulp with 1 part wallpaper glue paste.
5. Carefully line the inside of the top mould with prepared pulp
6. Insert bottom mould so that it holds its positive and negative shape.
7. Allow to air dry for 2-3 days or oven dry for 4 hours at 80 degrees C.

_Figures 7, 8 & 9 - Half of the final mould made from moulded cardboard pulp_

​

For these three experiments I used pulped cardboard to try and make a more rigid material. I only moulded half of the mould as a test for this material. I improved the process by using the smallest amount of water to begin with whilst blending, then adding the dry wallpaper glue powder to this damp mix before adding warm water until it got to a workable consistency. This meant that instead of taking around 7 hours in the oven drying, it took closer to 3.



## Moulded Paper Pulp Product

This product is both the protective packaging and the monitor stand itself. - so the important part of is physical design is that it protects as large a surface area as possible of the product whilst also reversing to become stand/raiser for the speaker.

Here is the product as a final product, both the Monitor Stand itself and the monitors protective packaging during postage. This took a single 'i' tabloid sized newspaper.

## Looking Forward


The weight limit of the final prototype was never tested, however both of the moulded pulp tests were suprisingly strong. However, after doing some first hand checks with 8" driver monitors \(like a Yamaha HS8\)  I discovered just how heavy they are. I am very confident however that for 6.5" driver monitors like the Yamaha HS7 mentioned earlier in the project, that they would/could be strong enough with only very little development.

​

I wish to experiment with a series of different moulded fibres to create a stronger more permanent product since as the product stands right now it feels like it could be easily discarded of.

Other materials I have spotted include; moulded hemp fibre, stiffened cotton felt and stiffened polyesther felt.
